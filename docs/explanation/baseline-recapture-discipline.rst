Baseline-recapture discipline
=============================

The rule: recapture the baseline the moment the template changes. Same
commit, same sitting, no exceptions.

Why the baseline exists at all
------------------------------------

Detection could, in principle, diff derived models against the live
template directly. It deliberately does not, for two reasons:

#. Retirement provenance. The ledger's ``retired`` events come from
   the recapture diff, previous baseline versus fresh snapshot. That
   diff is the only trustworthy proof that an object used to be
   template surface. No committed baseline, no proof, no automatable
   removals (see :doc:`ledger-and-revival`).
#. A reviewable truth. The baseline is a committed artifact: what the
   fleet compares against is in version control, changes to it show
   up in pull requests, and CI on any machine reproduces the same
   findings.

What goes wrong when you skip it
--------------------------------------

The failure is not "slightly outdated results"; a stale baseline
inverts meanings. Concretely, suppose the template drops column
``cleaned`` from a table and nobody recaptures:

- The baseline still lists ``cleaned`` as template truth.
- Derived models without it get flagged ``column.missing``, a false
  positive that reports the correct state as drift.
- The missing-object cascade tries to splice ``cleaned`` from a
  template that no longer carries it and crashes mid-sweep, or,
  resurrection-style, re-adds the column from an old copy, undoing the
  template edit fleet-wide.
- Meanwhile the drop is never recorded as a retirement, so models
  still carrying the column are never cleaned.

Every one of those is worse than a missed detection: the tool actively
fights the maintainer. This scenario is why the discipline is framed
as part of the template edit itself; an edit is not finished until the
baseline says so.

How the tool enforces it
----------------------------

Discipline backed by machinery, not memory:

- The stale-baseline guard. ``detect`` and ``remediate`` re-snapshot
  the live template and compare it to the committed baseline before
  doing anything; on mismatch they refuse with a clear message.
  ``--allow-stale`` exists for forensics (comparing against a
  historical baseline on purpose), and its flag name says exactly what
  you are accepting.
- Capture is atomic bookkeeping. One ``drift-doctor capture`` writes
  the fresh baseline and maintains the ledger (retirements appended,
  returns revived). There is no partial state where the baseline knows
  something the ledger does not.
- CI catches the forgetful. A pull request that edits the template
  without a recapture fails the ``detect`` step loudly (see
  :doc:`../how-to/run-in-ci`).

Practice
-----------

- Template edit, then ``drift-doctor capture``, then commit both,
  together. The reviewer sees the model change, the baseline change,
  and any new ledger events as one story.
- Read capture's output. ``[ledger] retired ...`` lines are the
  removals you just authorized for cascade; if one surprises you,
  investigate before anyone runs ``--sync``.
- Never hand-edit ``baseline.json`` to "fix" a finding; the baseline is
  a capture, not a config file. If the baseline is wrong, the template
  is wrong; fix that and recapture.
