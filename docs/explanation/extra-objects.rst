Extra objects
=============

Kinds: ``extra.measure``, ``extra.column``; advisory, never remediated

What it is
-------------

A derived model carries an object on a shared table that the template
does not define: a custom KPI added to the shared measures table, an
extra column on a template fact table. The suite reports these, and
does nothing about them, ever.

The doctrine: core, not superset
------------------------------------

Early fleet tooling is tempted to treat the template as a superset:
anything not in the template is cruft, delete it. That model is wrong
the first time a tenant pays for a custom KPI. The sustainable
contract is: the template is the canonical core. Every derived model
must contain it; derived models may legitimately extend beyond it.

From that one sentence, two consequences follow mechanically:

#. Absence from the template is not evidence of wrongness. An extra
   object might be tenant customization (keep), an experiment (their
   call), or debris from a template retirement (remove), and presence
   alone cannot distinguish the three.
#. The only automatable deletions are provably-ex-template objects,
   the ones the retirement ledger records. Everything else stays a
   human decision. This is why ``extra.*`` has no applier at all: not
   "off by default," structurally absent. See
   :doc:`ledger-and-revival`.

How extras arise
--------------------

- Genuine tenant customization (the healthy case).
- A measure renamed locally: the template name shows as missing, the
  local name as extra. Resolving the pair is a rename, not an add plus
  delete.
- Retirement debris on models that predate the ledger's history.

Detection logic
-------------------

Objects in the derived model's shared tables are checked against the
baseline. Anything absent from the baseline is bucketed:

- an active ledger retirement for that ref becomes a ``retire.*``
  finding (the one automatable removal);
- otherwise, ``extra.*``, advisory.

Two things are deliberately not findings at all: derived-only tables
(with everything on them) and derived-only mapping rows; whole-surface
extensions are the clearest form of legitimate customization, and
flagging them would train users to ignore the report.

What to do with advisories
------------------------------

- Nothing, usually. A stable set of extras per model is that tenant's
  custom surface; ``detect`` exits 0 when only advisories remain.
- If an extra should become standard, add it to the template and
  recapture; the finding disappears because the object is now core.
- If an extra is truly debris (never template-tracked, so the ledger
  cannot know it), delete it by hand. The suite will not do it for
  you, by design.
