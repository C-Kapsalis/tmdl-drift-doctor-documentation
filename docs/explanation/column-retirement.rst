Column retirement
=================

Kind: ``retire.column``

What it is
-------------

A single column was dropped from a template table that itself
survives. Derived models that still carry the column hold a stale
field, often one whose upstream source no longer exists, so it is one
refresh away from breaking, or already broken.

Why columns deserve their own kind
----------------------------------------

It is easy to build a retirement inventory of tables, measures, and
other whole objects and believe you are done, and then a template
column drop falls straight through it. This exact gap has a
characteristic, nasty failure signature worth understanding:

#. The template drops column ``X`` from table ``T``. The inventory
   tracks tables (``T`` survives) and measures; the column drop is
   recorded nowhere.
#. If the baseline is also stale (not recaptured), detection still
   lists ``X`` as template truth and flags every derived model without
   it as ``column.missing``, and the cascade then tries to splice
   ``X`` from a template that no longer has it, and crashes (or worse,
   resurrects the column from an old copy).
#. Models still carrying ``X`` are meanwhile reported as carrying an
   :doc:`extra <extra-objects>`, advisory, so the debris never gets
   cleaned.

The fix is structural: the retirement inventory must enumerate
``Table[Column]`` pairs, not just object names. Recapture then records
a dropped column as its own ``retired`` event, unless the whole table
was dropped, in which case the table entry covers it and no
per-column entries are written (one retirement, not thirty).

Detection logic
-------------------

For each active ``column`` retirement ``T[X]``: if the derived model
has table ``T`` and ``T`` still has column ``X``, emit
``retire.column``. Models without the host table are silently fine
(nothing to remove; if ``T`` itself is missing that is a different
finding).

Remediation semantics
-------------------------

Allowlist plus ``--sync`` gated, like every retirement. The column's
raw block (declaration, properties, annotations) is removed from the
derived table file; the write guards validate the result before it is
persisted. Idempotent; the next run finds no column to remove.

When not to auto-fix
------------------------

- Derived-only DAX still references the column. Template measures
  that used it were retired with it, but a tenant's custom measure
  reading ``T[X]`` will break when the column goes. Search the model
  for ``[X]`` references before syncing.
- The column still exists in that tenant's source and they use it.
  Then it is not debris for them; revive it for that model and move
  on.
- Ordering matters in mixed sweeps. When a retired measure references
  a retired column, remove the measure first (the suite orders measure
  removals before column removals within a sync pass for exactly this
  reason; keep that ordering if you script your own).
