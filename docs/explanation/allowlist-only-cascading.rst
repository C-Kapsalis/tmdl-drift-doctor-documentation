Allowlist-only cascading
========================

The rule: nothing cascades by default. Every automated fix is
authorized twice; the kind must be named in the allowlist, and
deletions additionally require ``--sync``.

Why default-deny
--------------------

A fleet tool that "fixes everything it finds" is a fleet-wide blast
radius with a progress bar. Detection is cheap to be liberal with; a
false positive costs a minute of reading. Remediation is not: a wrong
cascade lands the same wrong edit in every model at machine speed, and
the fleet's own history includes exactly that class of incident (see
:doc:`safe-tmdl-surgery` for one that shipped a syntax error to every
tenant at once).

Default-deny inverts the failure mode. A too-small allowlist means
some drift stays reported-but-unfixed; annoying, visible, safe. A
too-large "denylist" tool means an unanticipated kind cascades before
anyone thought about whether it should; silent, fleet-wide, and
discovered by a tenant.

The three gates
-------------------

#. ``allowlist.kinds``: the fleet-level policy of which finding kinds
   may be applied at all. Detection is unaffected: everything is still
   found and reported; the allowlist only opens the write path.
#. ``--sync`` for ``retire.*``: deletions get a second, per-run gate.
   A default ``remediate`` is purely additive or overwriting; removing
   objects is always an explicit choice made this run.
#. No gate can exist for advisories: ``extra.*`` kinds have no
   applier. That is the strongest form of default-deny: for
   derived-model-owned work, there is nothing to switch on (see
   :doc:`extra-objects`).

The sharpest example: named shared expressions
------------------------------------------------------

``expressions.tmdl`` shows why "cascade the whole surface" is
untenable. The file mixes:

- genuinely shared parameters, a reporting window start, feature
  toggles, that should track the template, and
- per-tenant connection parameters, warehouse name, project id,
  currency, that must never be touched, plus tenant-only expressions.

So the expression allowlist (``allowlist.expressions``) names the
shared set explicitly, and everything else is invisible to the tool:
not compared, not flagged, not cascadable. Gating detection itself
(not just remediation) is deliberate: a "finding" on a connection
parameter would train someone to allowlist it just to silence the
noise. The fixture fleet demonstrates it: ``Data Source`` differs in
every franchise and is never reported.

Choosing your allowlist
---------------------------

- Start additive-only: the ``*.missing`` kinds. Gaps are the safest
  cascades.
- Add the overwrite kinds (``*_drift``) once you trust your template
  hygiene; overwrites assume the template is right, which is a
  process claim, not a tool claim.
- Add ``retire.*`` last, after the ledger has history you have
  reviewed.
- Scope expression cascading to parameters you would be comfortable
  setting identically in every tenant today.
- When a kind keeps getting ``--kind``-filtered out of runs by hand,
  that is the signal to remove it from the allowlist; make the policy
  live in the file, not in habits.
