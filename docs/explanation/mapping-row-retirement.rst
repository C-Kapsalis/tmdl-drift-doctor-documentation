Mapping-row retirement
======================

Kind: ``retire.mapping_row`` (companion: ``mapping_row.missing``)

What it is
-------------

Fleets commonly carry small mapping tables, lookup tables whose rows
are data-as-model, defined inline in a calculated partition (a DAX
``DATATABLE`` literal): plan catalogs, category-to-metric groupings,
slicer configurations. The fixture fleet's ``Plan Map`` is one: each
row maps a plan key to a display name and a fee.

Mapping-row retirement is the surgical case: one row was dropped from
a mapping table that itself survives, the template discontinues the
``legacy-gold`` plan while ``basic``, ``plus``, and ``elite`` live on.
Derived models still carrying the row keep offering a dead option.

Why whole-table thinking fails here
-----------------------------------------

Coarser retirement kinds cannot express this:

- Table retirement would delete the survivors along with the dead
  row.
- Treating the whole partition source as one comparable blob turns any
  row difference into "the table drifted," with only an
  all-or-nothing rewrite as the fix, which would also flatten
  tenant-custom rows.

The row is the real unit of change, so the suite makes it the unit of
detection, retirement, and remediation. Rows are identified by a row
key (the first column value of the tuple), and each row's raw tuple
text is tracked in the baseline.

Detection logic
-------------------

- At recapture, a key present in the previous baseline's row set and
  absent from the fresh one is recorded as a ``mapping_row``
  retirement (``Table/row_key``), unless the whole table was dropped,
  which stays a single table entry.
- At detect time, each active row retirement is checked against the
  derived model's parsed rows; carriers get a ``retire.mapping_row``
  finding.
- Derived-only rows are not findings; custom rows are tenant
  customization, hands-off, the same doctrine as :doc:`extras
  <extra-objects>`.

Remediation semantics
-------------------------

Allowlist plus ``--sync`` gated. Exactly the ledger-listed row tuple is
removed from the ``DATATABLE`` literal, separator comma included;
sibling rows are kept, keeping them is the entire point of the kind.
The inverse operation (``mapping_row.missing``) inserts the template's
tuple after the last existing row. Both edits pass the standard write
guards and are idempotent.

When not to auto-fix
------------------------

- Tenant data still references the key. If a tenant's facts still
  arrive tagged ``legacy-gold``, removing the mapping row orphans that
  data in every visual that joins through the mapping table. Check
  usage first; revive per-model where the key must live on.
- The "row" is load-bearing config, not reference data. If downstream
  logic switches on the key's presence, coordinate the removal with
  the logic change instead of letting a sync pass race it.
- Ambiguous keys. Row identity is the first tuple element. If a
  mapping table's first column is not unique, fix the table design
  before trusting row-level tooling with it.
