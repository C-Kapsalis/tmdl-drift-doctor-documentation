Safe TMDL surgery
=================

The rule: edit TMDL as raw text blocks, validate before every write,
and never insert a property line into a DAX expression body.

Why raw-block splicing, not parse then re-serialize
------------------------------------------------------------

A diff-oriented parser keeps what it needs to compare and drops the
rest: lineage tags, annotations, format hints, description lines, the
exact formatting a desktop tool wrote. Rebuilding TMDL from such parsed
objects silently destroys everything the parser ignored. So the
remediation engine never serializes parsed dataclasses; it locates an
object's raw text block in the template file (declaration line,
``///`` descriptions, properties, annotations, byte-faithful) and
splices it into the derived file. Parsing is for deciding; text
surgery is for doing.

Two identity rules ride along:

- a block inserted into a model gets a fresh lineage tag (a copied tag
  can collide with an existing one, and the engine refuses to load a
  model with duplicate lineage tags);
- a block overwriting an existing object keeps the derived object's
  tag (stable identity, idempotent re-runs).

The DAX-injection hazard
----------------------------

The one TMDL-editing mistake that earns its own invariant. TMDL
expressions come in three shapes:

::

    measure 'Simple' = COUNTROWS(T)          # single-line
        formatString: #,0

    measure 'Fenced' = ```
            CALCULATE( ... )
            ```                              # fenced
        formatString: #,0

    measure 'Layered' =
            VAR _x = ...
            RETURN _x + 1                    # bare multi-line
        formatString: #,0

Single-line and fenced bodies have an obvious "after the expression"
insertion point for a property. The trap is the bare multi-line shape:
a naive "insert the property right after the declaration line" puts it
between the ``=`` and the DAX:

::

    measure 'Layered' =
        isHidden                              # now the first line of the expression
            VAR _x = ...

and the engine reads ``isHidden`` as DAX. The measure fails to compile
with a bare syntax error. Worse, the edit looks plausible in a diff,
and a fleet cascade multiplies it: this exact bug once landed dozens
of broken measures across every model in a production fleet in a
single automated pass, discovered only when reports started erroring.

How the invariant is enforced, twice
------------------------------------------

#. The writer does it right. ``insert_property_line`` classifies the
   expression shape and inserts after the whole body: after the
   closing fence for fenced bodies, after the last body line for bare
   multi-line ones. It is also idempotent; an already-present property
   is never duplicated.
#. The guard assumes the writer is wrong. ``assert_no_property_injection``
   independently scans content before any write: for every bare
   multi-line declaration, a property-keyword line appearing before
   the expression body (with body lines still following) raises, and
   the write is refused. The guard runs inside ``assert_tmdl_valid``,
   so every code path that persists TMDL passes it, including block
   replacements that should be safe by construction.

Belt and suspenders is deliberate: the incident taught that "the
writer handles all the shapes" is exactly the claim that fails on the
shape nobody listed.

The rest of the write guards
----------------------------------

Every candidate file content must also have: tab indentation only
(TMDL rejects space-indented lines), balanced ```` ``` ```` fences, and
no duplicated single-value property within one object (a second
``isHidden`` is as fatal as a misplaced one). Any violation raises
before the file is touched; a guarded edit either persists valid TMDL
or persists nothing.
