Property drift
==============

Kinds: ``measure.property_drift``, ``column.property_drift``

What it is
-------------

A shared object's presentation and typing metadata differs from the
template while its logic matches: format strings, hidden flags,
display folders, data types, summarization defaults. Individually
small; in aggregate this is what makes a fleet look unmaintained: the
same KPI shows two decimals in one tenant and none in another, a
helper measure is visible in one model's field list and hidden
everywhere else, a date column sorts as text in exactly one place.

How it arises
----------------

- Desktop editing side effects. Opening a model in a BI desktop tool
  and touching an object can rewrite properties (summarization
  defaults are notorious).
- Local cosmetic preferences: someone "just fixed the formatting" in
  one tenant.
- Partial template updates: the template gained a ``displayFolder``
  reorganization or a format-string standard, and only some models
  followed.
- Type coercion at the source: a warehouse column changed type and one
  model's ``dataType`` was hand-adjusted to match.

Detection logic
-------------------

For every shared object, a fixed set of single-value properties is
compared as a dict: ``dataType``, ``formatString``, ``displayFolder``,
``summarizeBy``, ``sourceColumn``, ``sortByColumn``, ``isHidden``.
Everything else, lineage tags, annotations, changed-property markers,
is identity or tooling metadata and is deliberately excluded: a model
resaved on another machine must not light up the fleet.

Property drift on measures is only reported when the expression
matches; if both diverge, one ``measure.expression_drift`` finding is
emitted and its remediation (block overwrite) fixes both.

Remediation semantics
-------------------------

Same mechanism as expression drift: the template's raw block replaces
the derived block, lineage tag preserved. Property fixes are never
assembled by patching individual lines into an existing block; that is
exactly the edit shape that once injected a property into a DAX
expression body and broke every affected measure (see
:doc:`safe-tmdl-surgery`). The block replacement is atomic and passes
the same write guards.

When not to auto-fix
------------------------

- ``dataType`` disagreements rooted in the source. If the tenant's
  warehouse really serves a different type, cascading the template's
  ``dataType`` breaks refresh. Fix the source or accept the divergence
  explicitly; do not let the cascade paper over a data contract
  problem.
- ``sourceColumn`` differences. These usually mean the tenant's view
  has a renamed column, a source-mapping question, not a cosmetic one.
- Deliberate per-tenant visibility. If one tenant hides a measure for
  contractual reasons, an auto-cascade will keep unhiding it. Treat it
  like any deliberate divergence: either tolerate the standing finding
  or restructure so the difference lives outside the shared surface.
