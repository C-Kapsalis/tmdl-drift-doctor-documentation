Expression drift
================

Kinds: ``measure.expression_drift``, ``expression.drift``

What it is
-------------

A shared object exists in both the template and a derived model, but
its logic differs: a measure's DAX body, or the value of a shared
parameter in ``expressions.tmdl``. This is the most dangerous drift
kind because it is invisible on the surface; the object is there, the
report renders, the number is simply different from what the
template's definition would produce. Two tenants comparing "the same
KPI" are comparing different formulas.

How it arises
----------------

- A local hotfix that never flowed back. Someone patched a measure in
  one tenant's model under time pressure and the template never
  learned about it (or the template got the proper fix and the
  hotfixed tenant kept the hack).
- The template's definition was improved, a divide-by-zero guard, a
  changed business rule, and only some models got the update.
- Experimentation residue: a maintainer tried a variant in a live
  model and forgot to revert.
- For shared parameters: a reporting window or feature toggle was
  advanced in the template and stragglers still carry the old value.

Detection logic
-------------------

Expressions are compared normalized: fence markers stripped, DAX and M
comments (``//``, ``--``, ``/* */``) removed, whitespace collapsed.
Reformatting a measure, reindenting, adding a comment, converting to a
fenced block, never registers as drift; only semantic-text changes do.

Two deliberate scope limits:

- Shared parameters are allowlist-named only. ``expressions.tmdl``
  mixes genuinely shared parameters with per-tenant connection
  settings; only the expressions named in ``allowlist.expressions`` are
  compared at all (see :doc:`allowlist-only-cascading`).
- Comparison keys on ``Table[Measure]``. A measure that moved to a
  differently-named host table in a derived model shows up as missing
  plus extra, not as expression drift.

Remediation semantics
-------------------------

The derived block is overwritten with the template's raw text block,
formatting, description lines, and annotations included, via
block-level text surgery (see :doc:`safe-tmdl-surgery`). The derived
object's existing lineage tag is preserved, so its identity is stable
and re-running the cascade is a no-op.

For ``expression.drift``, exactly the named expression block is
replaced; every other line of ``expressions.tmdl`` stays byte-untouched.

When not to auto-fix
------------------------

- The derived version is the correct one. Half of all expression drift
  is an unback-ported fix. Read the diff (``--dry-run``) before
  cascading: if the derived model is right, fix the template,
  recapture, and cascade in the other direction.
- Genuinely tenant-specific logic. If one tenant's business rule truly
  differs, an auto-cascade will keep reverting it. Model that
  properly, a tenant-specific measure under a different name, or a
  parameter the template reads, rather than fighting the fleet tooling.
- Blind bulk-accept. Overwriting is not destructive in the file sense
  (it is versioned), but it destroys information about why the
  divergence existed. The diff is the review artifact; look at it.
