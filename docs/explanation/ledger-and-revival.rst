The ledger and revival model
============================

The rule: every consequential act leaves an immutable line, and every
correction is a new line, never an erasure.

Why an append-only ledger
------------------------------

Fleet remediation is bulk mutation of other people's models. The
minimum standard for that is auditability: six months later, "why does
tenant alpha not have the evening-peak KPI?" must be answerable from
the record; retired from the template on this date, removed from alpha
by this sync run, these files touched. The ledger
(``ledger.jsonl``, one JSON event per line) is that record. Three
event types cover it:

- ``retired``: the template dropped an object (recorded at recapture);
- ``revived``: a retirement was canceled (by return-to-template or by
  hand);
- ``remediated``: a fix was applied to a model (kind, ref, action,
  files).

Append-only is what makes it evidence. A ledger you can edit is a
ledger you can quietly rewrite; a corrupt line therefore fails every
read loudly rather than being skipped; a half-readable ledger silently
mis-targeting a delete is the worst outcome available.

Retirement: deletion needs provenance
-------------------------------------------

The template is a core, not a superset, so "absent from the template"
can never justify deleting from a derived model; that description
also matches every legitimate tenant customization. The ``retired``
events carve out the one deletable population: objects provably
ex-template, witnessed by the recapture diff (previous baseline had
it, fresh snapshot does not). The ``retire.*`` channel acts only on
active ``retired`` events. No event, no removal, however suspicious an
object looks.

Revival: the escape hatch that keeps history
----------------------------------------------------

Retirement is a strong claim ("this object should not exist in
derived models") and reality overrides it in two ways:

- The template takes it back. At recapture, an actively-retired object
  found in the fresh snapshot is auto-stamped ``revived`` (fleet-wide).
  The retirement stands down; ordinary drift comparison resumes.
- A human overrides. ``drift-doctor ledger --revive`` records that a
  deliberate re-add, usually one tenant keeping an object the fleet
  dropped, must not be re-removed. Scoped with ``--model``, it
  protects exactly that model while the removal stays live for
  everyone else.

Both are events, so the fold is simple and the history stays complete:
retired puts it in force; revived cancels it (globally or per-model);
retired again later puts it in force again. You can always
reconstruct what the fleet believed at any point in time.

Design consequences worth noticing
----------------------------------------

- Undo is re-do. Restoring a wrongly-removed object is: put the block
  back, revive the ref (see :doc:`../how-to/recover-from-unwanted-remediation`).
  The mistake and the correction are both on the record.
- Dry runs leave no trace. ``--dry-run`` writes neither models nor
  ledger, so the ledger never claims things that did not happen.
- The ledger is shared state. Commit it with the models: retirement
  history is fleet policy, and two machines with different ledgers
  will disagree about what may be deleted.
- Duplicate suppression, not deduplication. Recapture never re-records
  an already-active retirement, and drops covered by a bigger drop
  (columns of a retired table) are represented by the one covering
  entry.
