Missing objects
===============

Kinds: ``table.missing``, ``column.missing``, ``measure.missing``,
``mapping_row.missing``

What it is
-------------

The template defines an object, a table, a column on a shared table, a
measure, a row of a mapping table, and a derived model does not have
it. The fleet contract is that the template is a canonical core: every
template object must exist in every derived model. A gap means some
tenant is missing functionality the template promises.

How it arises
----------------

- The template moved on. A new KPI or dimension landed in the template
  after a derived model was cloned, and nobody back-filled it. This is
  the overwhelmingly common case in any fleet older than a few months.
- A model joined the fleet late, cloned from an old copy of the
  template.
- Someone deleted the object in the derived model, by accident, or
  "cleaning up" something they did not recognize.
- A partial hand-cascade: a maintainer pushed a change to nine models
  and got interrupted before the tenth.

Detection logic
-------------------

The detector walks the committed baseline (not the live template; see
:doc:`baseline-recapture-discipline`) and checks each object's presence
in the derived model, matched by name:

- tables by table name;
- columns and measures by name within the same-named table;
- mapping rows by row key (the first column value of the ``DATATABLE``
  tuple).

Presence is all that is checked here; shared objects that exist but
diverge are the drift kinds (:doc:`expression-drift` and
:doc:`property-drift`).

Remediation semantics
-------------------------

Missing objects are the safest cascade; purely additive:

- Measures and columns are spliced as the template's raw text block
  (descriptions, format hints, and annotations ride along; parsed and
  re-serialized TMDL would silently drop them). The spliced block gets
  a fresh lineage tag: keeping the template's tag can collide with an
  existing tag in the derived model, which the engine rejects at load
  time.
- Tables are copied whole (every lineage tag regenerated) and
  registered in ``model.tmdl``.
- Mapping rows are inserted after the last existing row.

When not to auto-fix
------------------------

- ``table.missing`` when data sources differ. The copied partition
  carries the template's source query. If the tenant's warehouse
  layout differs, cascade the table, then fix its partition before
  deploying.
- A column the tenant's source cannot supply. The model will validate
  but the next refresh fails. Check the source before cascading
  ``column.missing`` for source-backed (non-calculated) columns.
- The object is missing because the tenant deliberately removed it.
  That is a policy conversation, not a bug. If the decision is "this
  tenant opts out," the honest states are: leave the finding standing
  as a known exception, or narrow the fleet so the model is not
  compared. Do not remediate-and-revert in a loop.
