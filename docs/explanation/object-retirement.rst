Object retirement (measures and tables)
=========================================

Kinds: ``retire.measure``, ``retire.table``

What it is
-------------

An object the template used to define was removed from it: superseded,
dead, or replaced. Derived models that still carry it hold stale
surface: a measure nobody maintains, a table whose upstream feed is
gone. Retirement is the channel that cascades template removals, the
mirror image of the missing-object cascade.

Why removals need their own channel
-----------------------------------------

Additions are easy: presence in the template is proof enough. Removals
are not symmetric, because the template is a core, not a superset; an
object's absence from the template is exactly what a legitimate tenant
customization looks like (:doc:`extra-objects`). Deleting on absence
would destroy tenant work.

The retirement ledger resolves the ambiguity with provenance: at every
recapture, objects present in the previous baseline but absent from
the fresh snapshot are recorded as ``retired`` events. Only that
recorded population is ever deletable. The proof is "this was template
surface and the template dropped it," never "I cannot find it."

Detection logic
-------------------

For each active (non-revived) ledger retirement, the detector checks
whether the derived model still carries the ref:

- ``retire.measure``: the measure still exists on the shared table;
- ``retire.table``: the table file still exists in the derived model.

Objects subsumed by a bigger drop are not double-tracked: when a whole
table is retired, its measures and columns are covered by the single
table entry.

Remediation semantics
-------------------------

Deletions are double-gated: the kind must be allowlisted and the run
must pass ``--sync``. A default ``remediate`` pass skips every
retirement with an explanatory reason; you cannot delete anything by
accident.

- ``retire.measure`` removes the measure's raw block from its host
  table file.
- ``retire.table`` deletes the table file and removes its
  ``ref table`` registration from ``model.tmdl``.

Both are idempotent, and both append ``remediated`` events to the
ledger.

When not to auto-fix
------------------------

- Something in the derived model still references the object. A
  derived-only measure whose DAX reads the retired table, a report
  visual bound to the retired measure. ``drift-doctor`` removes model
  objects; it does not rewrite your reports or your custom DAX. Sweep
  references first; removals that orphan references should be
  sequenced (dependents first), not forced.
- A tenant is contractually still using it. Revive it for that model
  (``ledger --revive ... --model NAME``) so the sync passes leave it
  alone, and keep everyone else on the removal path.
- The retirement itself was a mistake. Restore the object in the
  template and recapture; the ledger auto-stamps a fleet-wide revival
  and the channel stands down.
