Add a model to the fleet
========================

Goal: bring a new derived model under drift management.

1. Place the model
----------------------

The model must be a TMDL-format ``.SemanticModel`` folder with a
``definition/`` directory (``tables/*.tmdl``, ``model.tmdl``,
optionally ``expressions.tmdl``). Location is up to you; paths in
``fleet.yml`` are resolved relative to the fleet file.

2. Register it
------------------

Add one line under ``models:`` in ``fleet.yml``:

::

    models:
      alpha: franchises/alpha/GymChain.SemanticModel
      bravo: franchises/bravo/GymChain.SemanticModel
      charlie: franchises/charlie/GymChain.SemanticModel   # new

``load_fleet`` validates the path on the next run; a missing
``definition/`` directory fails loudly rather than silently skipping
the model.

3. Take stock before you fix anything
-------------------------------------------

Run a scoped, read-only detection first:

::

    $ drift-doctor detect --model charlie

A model that has lived away from the template for a while can carry a
lot of drift. Read the findings before remediating:

- Missing objects are usually safe to cascade.
- Expression and property drift overwrite the derived version; check
  the diffs with ``--dry-run`` in case the divergence was deliberate.
  If it was, either leave it (it will keep being reported) or narrow
  the allowlist.
- Extras are advisory; nothing will touch them.

4. Remediate incrementally
------------------------------

Cascade one kind at a time rather than everything at once:

::

    $ drift-doctor remediate --model charlie --kind measure.missing --dry-run
    $ drift-doctor remediate --model charlie --kind measure.missing
    $ drift-doctor remediate --model charlie --kind measure.expression_drift --dry-run
    ...

5. Retirements need a decision
------------------------------------

If objects were retired from the template before charlie joined the
fleet, the ledger already lists them, and ``detect`` will flag any that
charlie still carries as ``retire.*``. Decide per object:

- retired debris: ``drift-doctor remediate --model charlie --sync``
- deliberately kept: revive it for charlie only:

::

    $ drift-doctor ledger --revive "Visits[Peak Hour Visits]" --kind measure --model charlie

Caveats
----------

- ``table.missing`` copies the template's partition source verbatim.
  If the new model reads a different source, fix the partition after
  the cascade.
- Adding a model never requires a recapture; the baseline describes the
  template, not the fleet.
