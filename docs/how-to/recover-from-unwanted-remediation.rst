Recover from an unwanted remediation
====================================

Goal: a ``--sync`` pass removed an object that one derived model was
supposed to keep. Put it back, and make sure no future pass removes it
again.

1. Find out exactly what happened
---------------------------------------

The ledger records every applied action with the files it touched:

::

    $ drift-doctor ledger | grep "Peak Hour Visits"
    2026-...  retired     measure  Visits[Peak Hour Visits]
    2026-...  remediated  retire.measure  model=alpha  Visits[Peak Hour Visits] - remove retired measure block

2. Restore the object
-------------------------

Re-add the object to the derived model. Version control is the natural
source (``git checkout -- <table file>`` or copy the block from
history); otherwise paste the block back by hand.

At this point ``detect`` will flag it again; the retirement is still
active in the ledger:

::

    $ drift-doctor detect --kind retire.
    -- alpha: 1 finding(s)
      retire.measure               Visits[Peak Hour Visits]

3. Revive it
---------------

A revival is an append-only ledger event that cancels the retirement
without erasing its history. Scope it to the one model that keeps the
object:

::

    $ drift-doctor ledger --revive "Visits[Peak Hour Visits]" --kind measure \
        --model alpha --note "alpha keeps its evening-peak KPI"
    revived measure Visits[Peak Hour Visits] for model 'alpha'; it will not be re-removed.

Omit ``--model`` to revive fleet-wide (for example, when the retirement
itself was a mistake).

4. Verify
------------

::

    $ drift-doctor detect --kind retire.     # no finding for alpha
    $ drift-doctor remediate --sync          # will not re-remove it

Other models still carrying the object remain flagged; a model-scoped
revival protects exactly one model.

Notes
--------

- If the object later returns to the template, the next ``capture``
  auto-revives it fleet-wide and normal drift comparison resumes.
- Never edit or delete ledger lines to "undo"; the ledger is
  append-only by design (see
  :doc:`../explanation/ledger-and-revival`). Every correction is a new
  event.
