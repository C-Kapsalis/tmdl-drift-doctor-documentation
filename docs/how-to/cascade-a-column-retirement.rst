Cascade a column retirement
===========================

Goal: you removed a column from the template, and every derived model
that still carries it should drop it too.

This walkthrough uses a column, but the flow is identical for measures,
whole tables, and mapping rows; they are all retirement kinds.

1. Retire the column in the template
------------------------------------------

Edit the template's table file and delete the column block (declaration
line plus its two-tab properties and annotations). Also remove any
template measures that referenced the column; the template must be
self-consistent.

2. Recapture immediately
----------------------------

::

    $ drift-doctor capture
    baseline written: .drift-doctor/baseline.json
      ...
      [ledger] retired column: Classes[Capacity]

This step does two things at once:

#. The baseline stops listing the column. Without this, ``detect``
   would flag every derived model as ``column.missing`` and the
   missing-object cascade would resurrect the column from a template
   that no longer has it.
#. The recapture diff (previous baseline versus fresh snapshot) proves
   the column used to be in the template, and appends a ``retired``
   event to the ledger. That proof is what authorizes the removal;
   absence alone never does (see
   :doc:`../explanation/allowlist-only-cascading`).

3. See who still carries it
---------------------------------

::

    $ drift-doctor detect --kind retire.
    -- alpha: 1 finding(s)
      retire.column                Classes[Capacity]

4. Cascade the removal
--------------------------

Retirements are deletions, so they are double-gated: the kind must be
in the allowlist (``retire.column``) and the run must opt in with
``--sync``:

::

    $ drift-doctor remediate --kind retire.column --sync --dry-run   # preview
    $ drift-doctor remediate --kind retire.column --sync
    [applied] alpha: retire.column Classes[Capacity] - remove retired column block

A plain ``drift-doctor remediate`` (no ``--sync``) skips every
``retire.*`` finding with an explanatory reason; a default pass is
purely additive or overwriting.

5. Verify and note the edge cases
-----------------------------------------

::

    $ drift-doctor detect --kind retire.
    $ drift-doctor ledger | tail

- The run is idempotent: a second ``--sync`` pass finds nothing to
  remove.
- A derived model that never had the column is untouched (no finding).
- If a derived model's own measures still reference the dropped
  column, removing the column will break them at refresh time.
  ``drift-doctor`` does not parse derived-only DAX for you; grep the
  model for ``[Capacity]`` before syncing if you are unsure.
- If one franchise must keep the column, revive it for that model
  first; see :doc:`recover-from-unwanted-remediation`.
