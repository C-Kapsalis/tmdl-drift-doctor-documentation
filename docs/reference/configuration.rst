fleet.yml configuration
=======================

One file configures a fleet. All paths are resolved relative to the
file's directory.

::

    version: 1                                  # required, must be 1

    template: template/GymChain.SemanticModel   # required, the golden model
    models:                                     # required, non-empty map
      alpha: franchises/alpha/GymChain.SemanticModel
      bravo: franchises/bravo/GymChain.SemanticModel

    mapping_tables:                             # optional, tables whose DATATABLE
      - Plan Map                                #   rows are diffed row-by-row

    state_dir: .drift-doctor                    # optional, default .drift-doctor
                                                #   holds baseline.json + ledger.jsonl

    allowlist:                                  # optional, an EMPTY allowlist means
      kinds: [...]                              #   nothing is ever remediated
      expressions: [...]

Every model path (template included) must contain a ``definition/``
directory; ``load_fleet`` fails loudly otherwise.

``allowlist.kinds``
-----------------------

The drift kinds ``remediate`` may apply. Anything not listed is
detected and reported but never fixed. Valid values:

::

    table.missing            column.missing          column.property_drift
    measure.missing          measure.expression_drift  measure.property_drift
    expression.drift         mapping_row.missing
    retire.table             retire.column           retire.measure
    retire.mapping_row

``extra.measure`` and ``extra.column`` are not valid here; advisories
have no applier by design.

Notes:

- ``retire.*`` kinds are additionally gated behind the ``--sync`` flag;
  listing them here is necessary but not sufficient.
- Prefix filtering on the command line (``--kind measure.``)
  intersects with this list; the allowlist is the outer boundary.

``allowlist.expressions``
-----------------------------

The named shared expressions (``expressions.tmdl`` blocks) that
participate in drift at all. This list gates detection as well as
remediation: an expression not named here is never compared, so it can
never be flagged or cascaded.

Why so strict: ``expressions.tmdl`` is a mixed file. It typically holds
per-tenant connection parameters (warehouse names, project ids,
currencies) alongside a small set of genuinely shared parameters
(reporting window dates, feature toggles). Cascading the whole file
would repoint every tenant's data source. Name exactly the parameters
that are canonical in the template, and nothing else.

``mapping_tables``
----------------------

Tables listed here get row-level treatment: their partition source is
parsed as a DAX ``DATATABLE`` literal and each row (keyed by its first
column value) becomes a diffable unit. This enables:

- ``mapping_row.missing``: a template row a derived model lacks;
- ``retire.mapping_row``: a row retired from the template, removed
  from derived models while sibling rows survive.

Rows that exist only in a derived model are left alone; custom rows are
tenant customization, the same doctrine as extra measures.

State files
--------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - File
     - Role
     - Commit it?
   * - ``<state_dir>/baseline.json``
     - The committed template truth.
     - Yes
   * - ``<state_dir>/ledger.jsonl``
     - Append-only audit and retirement record.
     - Yes

Both are shared fleet state: detection is only meaningful when
everyone, and CI, reads the same baseline and the same retirement
history.
