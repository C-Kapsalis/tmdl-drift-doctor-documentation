Ledger format
=============

``<state_dir>/ledger.jsonl``: one JSON object per line, append-only.
Reads fold the stream in order; nothing is ever rewritten or deleted. A
malformed line makes every read fail loudly: a corrupt ledger must
never silently disable or mis-target a removal.

Common fields
----------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Meaning
   * - ``ts``
     - string
     - UTC ISO-8601 timestamp, appended automatically
   * - ``event``
     - string
     - ``retired`` / ``revived`` / ``remediated``
   * - ``kind``
     - string
     - See per-event tables below
   * - ``ref``
     - string
     - Object reference (formats below)

Reference formats: tables use ``TableName``; columns and measures use
``Table[Object]``; mapping rows use ``Table/row_key``.

``retired``
--------------

Appended by ``capture`` when an object present in the previous baseline
is absent from the fresh snapshot. This is the proof of ex-template
existence that authorizes later removal.

::

    {"ts": "2026-07-17T09:30:11+00:00", "event": "retired", "kind": "measure",
     "ref": "Visits[Peak Hour Visits]", "source": "capture"}

``kind`` is one of ``table``, ``column``, ``measure``,
``mapping_row``. Mapping-row events additionally carry ``table`` and
``row_key``.

``revived``
--------------

Cancels an active retirement without erasing it.

::

    {"ts": "...", "event": "revived", "kind": "measure",
     "ref": "Visits[Peak Hour Visits]", "source": "manual",
     "model": "alpha", "note": "alpha keeps its evening-peak KPI"}

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Meaning
   * - ``source``
     - ``capture`` (the object returned to the template) or ``manual``
       (``ledger --revive``)
   * - ``model``
     - Present on model-scoped revivals only; absent means fleet-wide
   * - ``note``
     - Optional human reason

``remediated``
------------------

Appended by ``remediate`` for every applied action (never in
``--dry-run``).

::

    {"ts": "...", "event": "remediated", "kind": "retire.measure",
     "model": "alpha", "ref": "Visits[Peak Hour Visits]",
     "action": "remove retired measure block",
     "files": [".../tables/Visits.tmdl"]}

Here ``kind`` is the finding kind (for example ``measure.missing``,
``retire.column``), ``action`` is the human-readable label of what was
done, and ``files`` lists every file the action touched.

The fold: how state is derived
------------------------------------

``active_retirements(model)`` walks the stream in order:

#. ``retired`` puts ``(kind, ref)`` in force.
#. ``revived`` removes it: if the event has no ``model``, for
   everyone; if it has one, only when it matches the model being asked
   about.
#. A later ``retired`` for the same ``(kind, ref)`` puts it in force
   again.

``remediated`` events never affect the fold; they are pure audit.
