CLI reference
=============

All commands take ``--fleet PATH`` (default ``fleet.yml``).

``drift-doctor capture``
----------------------------

Snapshot the template into ``<state_dir>/baseline.json`` and maintain
the retirement record.

::

    $ drift-doctor capture [--fleet fleet.yml]

Behavior:

#. Parses the live template and writes the fresh snapshot as the
   baseline.
#. If a previous baseline exists, diffs it against the fresh snapshot:
   objects present before and absent now become ``retired`` ledger
   events (kinds: ``table``, ``column``, ``measure``, ``mapping_row``;
   objects covered by a larger drop, such as a column of a dropped
   table, are not double-recorded); actively-retired objects present
   again become ``revived`` ledger events.

Exit code: 0 on success.

``drift-doctor detect``
---------------------------

Read-only drift detection for every derived model.

::

    $ drift-doctor detect [--json] [--model NAME] [--kind PREFIX] [--allow-stale]

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Effect
   * - ``--json``
     - Emit findings as a JSON array (``kind``, ``model``, ``ref``,
       ``template_value``, ``derived_value``, ``detail``, ``advisory``).
   * - ``--model NAME``
     - Only the named derived model.
   * - ``--kind PREFIX``
     - Only findings whose kind starts with the prefix (for example
       ``measure.``, ``retire.``).
   * - ``--allow-stale``
     - Proceed even if the template changed since the last capture.

Exit codes: 0, no remediable findings (advisories alone do not fail); 1,
remediable drift exists; error if the baseline is missing or stale
(unless ``--allow-stale``).

``drift-doctor remediate``
-------------------------------

Cascade template truth into the derived models.

::

    $ drift-doctor remediate [--kind PREFIX] [--dry-run] [--sync] [--model NAME] [--allow-stale]

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Effect
   * - ``--kind PREFIX``
     - Only remediate findings whose kind starts with the prefix.
   * - ``--dry-run``
     - Compute every edit and print unified diffs; write nothing, not
       the models, not the ledger.
   * - ``--sync``
     - Also apply ``retire.*`` removals. Without it, every retirement
       finding is skipped with a reason.
   * - ``--model NAME``
     - Only the named derived model.
   * - ``--allow-stale``
     - Proceed on a stale baseline (misclassification risk).

Every finding passes three gates before an edit happens: the allowlist
(kind must be named in ``fleet.yml``), the sync gate (``retire.*``
needs ``--sync``), and the write guards (the new content must be valid
TMDL: tab-indented, balanced fences, no duplicate properties, no
property inside a DAX body). Applied actions are appended to the
ledger.

Exit codes: 0 on success (including "nothing to do"); 1 if any apply
failed.

``drift-doctor ledger``
---------------------------

Inspect the ledger, or record a manual revival.

::

    $ drift-doctor ledger [--json]
    $ drift-doctor ledger --revive REF --kind KIND [--model NAME] [--note TEXT]

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Effect
   * - ``--json``
     - Print raw JSONL entries.
   * - ``--revive REF``
     - Cancel the active retirement of ``REF`` (for example
       ``"Visits[Peak Hour Visits]"``, ``"Plan Map/legacy-gold"``).
       Requires ``--kind``.
   * - ``--kind KIND``
     - Retirement kind: ``table``, ``column``, ``measure``,
       ``mapping_row``.
   * - ``--model NAME``
     - Scope the revival to one derived model. Default: fleet-wide.
   * - ``--note TEXT``
     - Human reason, stored on the event.

Reviving a ref with no active retirement is an error (exit 1); it
usually means a typo, and a silent no-op would hide it.
