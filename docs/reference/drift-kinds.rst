Drift-kind catalog
==================

Every finding has a dotted ``kind``. The catalog below gives, for each
kind: what triggers it, what remediation does, and the gates it must
pass.

Gates legend: A, must be in ``allowlist.kinds``; S, additionally
requires ``--sync``; none, advisory, never remediated.

Missing objects (template to derived)
-------------------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Kind
     - Trigger
     - Remediation
     - Gates
   * - ``table.missing``
     - A baseline table is absent from the derived model
     - Copy the template's table file (all lineage tags regenerated),
       register ``ref table`` in ``model.tmdl``. The partition source
       is the template's; review it.
     - A
   * - ``column.missing``
     - A baseline column is absent from a shared table
     - Splice the template's raw column block (fresh lineage tag)
     - A
   * - ``measure.missing``
     - A baseline measure is absent from a shared table
     - Splice the template's raw measure block, ``///`` description
       included (fresh lineage tag)
     - A
   * - ``mapping_row.missing``
     - A baseline mapping-table row (by row key) is absent
     - Insert the template's row tuple after the last existing row
     - A

Divergence on shared objects
--------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Kind
     - Trigger
     - Remediation
     - Gates
   * - ``measure.expression_drift``
     - Normalized DAX differs (comments, fences, and whitespace never
       count)
     - Overwrite the derived block with the template's raw block; the
       derived lineage tag is preserved
     - A
   * - ``measure.property_drift``
     - Expressions match but compared properties differ
       (``formatString``, ``isHidden``, ``displayFolder``, and so on)
     - Same block overwrite
     - A
   * - ``column.property_drift``
     - A shared column's compared properties differ (``dataType``,
       ``formatString``, ``summarizeBy``, and so on)
     - Same block overwrite
     - A
   * - ``expression.drift``
     - An allowlist-named shared expression differs or is absent
     - Replace or append exactly that expression block; everything
       else in ``expressions.tmdl`` stays byte-untouched
     - A (and named in ``allowlist.expressions``; gates detection too)

When a measure's expression and properties both drift, one
``measure.expression_drift`` finding is emitted; the block overwrite
fixes both. Lineage tags and annotations never participate in
comparison.

Extras (derived to template), advisory
--------------------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Kind
     - Trigger
     - Remediation
     - Gates
   * - ``extra.measure``
     - A derived measure on a shared table with no template counterpart
     - None; reported only
     - none
   * - ``extra.column``
     - A derived column on a shared table with no template counterpart
     - None; reported only
     - none

Derived-only tables (and their contents) are not findings at all, and
neither are derived-only mapping rows; extending the template is
legitimate. See :doc:`../explanation/extra-objects`.

Retirements (ledger-driven deletions)
-------------------------------------------

Emitted only for objects with an active ``retired`` ledger event
(recorded automatically at recapture, cancelable by revival) that a
derived model still carries.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Kind
     - Trigger
     - Remediation
     - Gates
   * - ``retire.table``
     - Ledger-retired table still in the derived model
     - Delete the table file and deregister from ``model.tmdl``
     - A + S
   * - ``retire.column``
     - Ledger-retired column still on a shared table
     - Remove the column block
     - A + S
   * - ``retire.measure``
     - Ledger-retired measure still on a shared table
     - Remove the measure block
     - A + S
   * - ``retire.mapping_row``
     - Ledger-retired row still in a mapping table
     - Remove exactly that row tuple; sibling rows are kept
     - A + S

Exit-code semantics
-----------------------

``detect`` exits 1 when any non-advisory finding exists; advisories
alone exit 0. ``remediate`` exits 1 only when an apply failed.
